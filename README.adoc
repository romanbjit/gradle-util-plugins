== Overview

When classpath for a Gradle `JavaExec` or `Test` task is long, Windows command executions give error because of limitation to command line length greater than 32K.

With a number of classpath dependencies in a large project, typically JavaExec Gradle task fails with error "The filename or extension is too long" and this would be a stopping error. To solve this issue, use ManifestClasspath plugin.

`ManifestClasspath` plugin creates a manifest jar for jar files in the classpath
of every https://docs.gradle.org/current/javadoc/org/gradle/process/JavaForkOptions.html[JavaForkOptions] task and sets the classpath with manifest jar.
This includes `JavaExec`, `Test` and other similar tasks.

== Installation

Follow the steps described at https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/com.github.ManifestClasspath[Gradle Plugin Portal page].
